## Lisence

## Features
The Website features 4 main pages, The Home page, Project Gallery, Skills and Contact pages.
- Home Page is the starting screen and offers information about me and links to my socials.
- Project Gallery is a bootstrap carousel which uses a map function to dynamically create each instance of a project within the carousel using a JSON file so that more can be added just by adding more projects to the JSON file.
- Skills uses two jsx files the main Skills Gallery which is similar to project gallery only this time it maps over the skills javascript which creates a card using a JSON file for each skill this is so that I can easily put more skills that I will learn in the future.
- Contact Page is a simple edited bootstrap form that on submission uses an application called getform to handle the input and send it to my email.
- The navigation uses Router Dom in order to create a single paged application so that the page is never refreshed.
